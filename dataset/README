To save gameplay data use `capture.py` script. Xbox controller is needed.

RB - pause/unpause capture
Y button - kills the script (script has to be paused)

I recommend to change the inputs library code for better performance if you have stuttering:

To create a dataset:
1. run data processing
2. run data balancing

Check extra_data.py if you would like to download the dataset.
